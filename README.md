My name is Tai and I'm a front-end developer. I work mostly with TypeScript and I like to focus on React.js/React Native projects.

Here you'll find personal projects written in TypeScript/Javascript and Python, as well as other minor projects.

## What I do

I'm currently a Software Developer at [Pipefy](https://www.pipefy.com/).

Sometimes I publish on my personal [blog](https://moonk23.hashnode.dev/).

I led the development of the [Data Journalism Toolbox](https://github.com/escola-de-dados/toolkit_ddj), a collaborative toolbase created by [Escola de Dados](https://github.com/escola-de-dados), a branch of [Open Knowledge Brasil](https://ok.org.br/sobre/).

I also developed [Bandej√£oBot UFRJ](https://github.com/taiporto/bandejaobot-ufrj), a bot that posts the UFRJ's (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) cafeteria menu everyday to Bluesky and X.
